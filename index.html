Because of this property the transistor can operate as an amplifier     of electric signals (like in your audio player) or as a switch controlled     by other switches (like in the logic circuits of your computer). Transistors     can be packed densely on semiconductor chips (up to 1000000000 per square     centimetre), are fast (can respond in less than 0.000000001 seconds), and     are reliable (keep functioning for dozens of years).</p>  <p class="c2">The nano-scale <strong>integration</strong> of large numbers of     transistors and other elements creates systems and applications that define     how the world works, plays, and communicates today. For example, microsystems     around us keep us connected, sense physical quantities, make decisions using     built-in processing capacity, and assist us in our daily lives, like in cell     phones, video games, air bags, pacemakers, fuel cells, water quality systems,     and so on. The semiconductor industry is the manufacturing business with the     largest added value and, at the same time, one of the most eco-friendly on     the planet.</p><p class="c2">Innovative <strong>designs</strong> and process technology provide nearlyall of the added value in semiconductor devices. Designing integrated circuits andmicrosystems involves challenging theoretical and practical problems and requires a solidengineering background and a good dose of creativity. I like doing research and trainingstudents in this field, because it is a highly rewarding activity that contributes toimproving quality of life, health, and environment. Over the last few years, I designedseveral microsystems with coworkers and students and I captured some of them in themicrophotographs below. Those chips were fabricated by STMicroelectronics and TSMC inCMOS technologies with minimum features at 180 nm, 130 nm, and 90 nm.</p><div id="photos"><table width="720" border="0"><tbody><tr align="center" valign="middle"><td><img src="images/chipml.jpg" alt="chip 130 nm" width="210" height="134"></td><td><img src="images/chipicfg.jpg" alt="chip 130 nm" width="160" height="134"></td><td><img src="images/chipos.jpg" alt="chip 90 nm" width="244" height="134"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>University of Guelph</h2><table width="720" border="0"><tbody><tr align="center" valign="middle"><td width="144"><a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/"><img src="images/logos/logouog.jpg"alt="UOG" width="56" height="84" border="0"></a></td><td width="144"><a href="http://www.cpes.uoguelph.ca/"><img src="images/logos/logocpes.jpg" alt="CPES" width="60" height="50" border="0"></a></td><td width="144"><a href="http://www.soe.uoguelph.ca/"><img src="images/logos/logosoe.jpg"alt="SOE" width="113" height="25" border="0"></a></td><td width="144">&nbsp;</td><td width="144">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="footer">&copy; 2009 Stefano Gregori :: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">W3C</a> :: layout design by <a title="derby web design" href="http://www.tristarwebdesign.co.uk">Tristar Web Design</a></div></body></html>
